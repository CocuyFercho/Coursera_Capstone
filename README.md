<b>Please note:</b>
<blockquote>The execution of the notebook's final version takes SEVERAL HOURS. It is possible to reduce the execution time by commenting some of the most time consumming calculations:
  
  1) In the section features correlation, comment out the generation of the correlation matrices, especially the ones using the full dataset,
  
  2) In the function loop_clasf_engine comment out some of the classifiers, especially the KNeighborsClassifier which takes a long time to calculate.</blockquote>
